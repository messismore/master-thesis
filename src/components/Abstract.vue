  <Comment>Elevator Pitch/Abstract</Comment>
  <p>
    This thesis explores the potential of networked, composable tools as a means
    to capture and distribute organisational knowledge. Drawing from the concept
    of
    <em>Continuous Integration</em>, a widely adopted collaboration strategy in
    software development making heavy use of automation, it proposes an
    automatisation platform for AEC workflows as a demonstrator of such a
    networked tool. I argue this will ultimately require a renegotiation of the
    relationship between architects and their tools and I speculate about a
    culture of toolmaking as a means to capture and evolve organisational
    knowledge.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Architecture, and the built environment in general, share the paradoxical
    quality of being both accelerator and key to many of the overlapping and
    mutually reinforcing crises unfolding around us. In order to unlock its
    potential to store carbon rather than emit greenhouse gases, preserve
    biodiversity rather than devour habitats, and foster community rather than
    divide and displace vulnerable demographics, planners need to radically
    transform the way we design, build, operate, and recycle our built
    environment. Materialising this new sustainable, robust, and resilient
    architecture calls for new levels of precision while facilitating deliberate
    experimentation, the integration of unfamiliar and rapidly evolving areas of
    knowledge as well as the rediscovery and cultivation of old ones, and the
    navigation of unprecedented complexity in order to arrive at something
    simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    This collective learning process is interacting with and accelerating
    broader trends that affect not only the AEC industry, but knowledge work in
    general: 1. the drive to increase efficiencies, 2. the emergence of new
    players and business models, 3. the move away from bespoke services, and,
    finally, 4. the decomposition and 5. routinisation of professional work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I argue that this reorganisation of work, combined with the demand to
    rapidly create and integrate new knowledge calls for a new generation of
    highly specialised, networked tools, that can be composed in vertically
    integrated, fluid processes or workflows. A design process that emphasises
    as result not only the built artefact but also the production of knowledge
    of how to improve future iterations of itself can leverage toolmaking as a
    means to store this knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tools, especially digital tools, encapsulate knowledge and make it
    accessible to a broader user base. Tools have thus the potential to capture
    and distribute organisational knowledge. But tools also encroach on the
    agency of their user. This happens explicitly (Big Tech: Gatekeepers) as
    well as implicitly (nudges).
  </p>
  <p>
    That's why these new tools need to possess certain characteristics: They
    need to be scrutable, hackable, composable, etc. That's why we need to
    rediscover our culture of tool-building.

  <h3>Methods and Data</h3>
  <p>
    Ich mache 3 case studies. (Sind das überhaupt case studies? Demonstrators?)
    Speckle ist ein Baustein. Mein Problem ist, dass der Text oben mit dem was
    ich mache gefühlt herzlich wenig zu tun hat? Ich baue ein "spekulatives
    Tool". Speckle! Kann ich in irgendeiner Form Daten erheben? Bisher war das
    eben alles handgeklöppelt, ich zeige, dass sich diese Methoden und
    Abstraktionen aus der Softwareentwicklung übertragen lassen und accessible +
    scrutable sind. Und ich will zeigen, dass da irgendwie Wissen drin ist. Was
    erhoffe ich mir davon?

  <p>Trigger -> Action Paradigm as powerful abstraction</p>

  <h3>Findings</h3>
  <p>
    I show that (1) the abstractions and paradigms of
    <em>Continuous Integration</em> lend themselves well to AEC workflows and
    that (2) such an automation platform can be regarded as a step towards a
    future of networked tools and enabler of a new culture of toolmaking.
